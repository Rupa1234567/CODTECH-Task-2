Overview of the Project 

Project : GRADE TRACKER

The `GradeTracker` program uses several Java technologies and concepts:

1. **`Scanner` Class**: For reading user input from the console.
2. **`ArrayList` and `List`**: For dynamically storing and managing a collection of grades.
3. **Custom Class (`Grade`)**: For representing each grade with a subject and score.
4. **Loops**: Specifically a `while` loop for continuous input until the user types "done."
5. **Control Flow Statements**: `if-else` for handling conditional logic, such as checking if any grades were entered and determining letter grades.
6. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: For calculating the total and average grades.
7. **String Methods**: Such as `equalsIgnoreCase` for comparing input strings. 

These technologies work together to collect, process, and display student grades and calculate their average, letter grade, and GPA.
